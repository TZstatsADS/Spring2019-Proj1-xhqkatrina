### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2019

+ Projec title: Happiness in Different Life Stages: Similar or Not
+ This project is conducted by Haiqing Xu

+ Project summary: This project aims to find out whether happy moments provided by workers in different age groups are similar or not. Creating wordclouds shows that “friend” is always a big theme in the wordclouds regardless of age group. Meanwhile, it seems as people ages, they mention their children (e.g. “daughter” and “son”) more frequently. After further dividing workers in each age group based on parenthood, we find out for older adults with children, the word “friend” is no longer among the most frequent words anymore. For people who do not have children, the wordclouds look similiar regardless of age group. Using topic modelling, we observe slight differences in topic allocation among three age groups but the difference is not huge.
